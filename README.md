Let me start by saying this: Software development is a powerful tool for shaping the future, and I’m here to contribute my part in creating innovative, impactful systems.

Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you a bit about myself <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minhkhoiv12/minhkhoiv12/master/smario.gif" width="35" />

- 🖥️ I’m currently a student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Education (HCMUE), majoring in Software Technology.
- 🖨️ I’m particularly interested in backend development and cloud technologies, focusing on creating systems that can handle high-performance workloads and ensure seamless user experiences.
- 📚 In my free time, I like exploring open-source projects, contributing to coding communities, and staying updated with the latest in software architecture.
- 🎮 When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing video games that require strategic thinking and teamwork
- 🚴‍♂️ I’m also an outdoor enthusiast, and I love going on long bike rides around the city to clear my mind and recharge my creativity.
- 🤯 Fun fact: I often find myself debugging code in my head, even when I'm not near a computer—problem-solving has become a second nature
